              I am a passionate UI/UX designer with an Artificial Intelligence
              and Machine Learning background. I was born and brought up in
              Hyderabad, and I have always been very fond of art. It all started
              when I was twelve years old and had the wonderful opportunity to
              work with an art gallery that represented my school.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
              In my undergraduate journey, I have found the perfect mix of
              technical expertise and creative intuition. Ever since I&apos;ve
              tried to bring together experiences that are simple and intuitive
              helping people have an easier and fun life. I worked updating
              website designs for certain clients at Envox Media and helped in
              boosting traffic to their site and the corporation&apos;s site.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
              Each of the projects that I have done forms a block and has made
              me appreciate the importance of empathy in design. This Website is
              the manifestation of my narrative â€“ a place where I thought out my
              development, artistry, and commitment to this profession.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
              My entrepreneurial journey has also been a driving force in my
              career goals. Having been working as a founder for a fashion
              brand, I found out that product design and management are
              essential to capturing the principles of ideals and usefulness. A
              key goal is to apply HCI principles for improvements in the field
              of user interface design and make my brand&apos;s web presence
              reflect the class and grandeur of its products.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Besides the digital world, my other interests include food,
              traveling, and dancing. I try to find beauty in everyday moments
              that inspire me and my work.
